# Haskell Exercises
This is a collection of exercises for learning Haskell. Each exercise comes with tests for verifying your solution.

You are free to use these exercises in workshops and other learning material.

It's all a bit rough around the edges and pull requests are most welcome :)

## Getting started
* Install [Stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack)
* Clone this repo
* Inside the `exercises` directory, run `stack setup` once to install GHC
* To build and run the tests: `stack test` (or `stack test --file-watch` if you want to rerun the tests automatically after making a change)
